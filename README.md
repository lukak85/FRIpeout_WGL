Currently working:
* Object spawning
* Basic driving mechanics
* Basic lighting
* Fog (although it needs some tweaking)
* Non-static amera attached to the object (delayed movement to behind the player)
* Menu with vehicle selection (the actual vehicle selection yet to be implemented)

To add/wishlist:
* Collision detection
* Motion blur
* UI
